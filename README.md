CRACK_A_LOT

the confidential file had a lot of passwords which were able to be brute forced , but there was a limit.then i knew before that if we have a bssid we can identify the required thing without bruteforcing. so after this i opened it in wireshark and searched for bssid and then i gotit . then using chatgpt i came to know of aircrackng. then i used some commands and searched within these numeous passkeys and got one specific one . c4t5_4r3_c00l.
